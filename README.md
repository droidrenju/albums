### Architecture

MVVM is a Model-View-ViewModel architecture that removes the tight coupling between each component.
Most importantly, in this architecture the children don't have the direct reference to the parent,
they have the reference through observables.

### Layers

- Domain
    - It represents the business logic of the Android application. It consists of the use-cases and
      use-case can be used for handling business logic. Apps ui layer will be communicating to data
      layer through this layer.

- Data
    - It represents the data and the business logic of the Android application. It consists of the
      logic - local and remote data source, model classes and the repository.

- View
    - It consists of the UI code. It sends the user action to the ViewModel but does not get the
      response back directly. To get the response, it has to subscribe to the observables which the
      ViewModel exposes to it.

- ViewModel
    - This is a bridge between the View and the Domain layer). It does not have any clue which view
      has to use it as it does not have a direct reference to the View.
